### To fine-tune STAuRED model you need to follow the below steps:
1. Prepare data by running the following:
  >preprocess_AuRED.sh<\br>
**Note: we shared the output of this step here. You can use our prepared data where we selected 4 negative examples. If you want to experiement with different numbers of negative examples, you need to modify *neg_ratio 4* to the required value in *preprocess_AuRED.sh* **
